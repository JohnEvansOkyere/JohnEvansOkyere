I’m a **results-driven Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer** who turns data into actionable insights and production-ready AI solutions. My expertise spans:

* Designing and deploying **predictive models, recommendation engines, and RAG/AI agent systems**
* Automating workflows and processes as an **n8n Automation Specialist**
* Building full-stack AI applications with **Flask, Streamlit, and FastAPI**
* Creating interactive dashboards using **Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**
* Leveraging **ML/DL frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Random Forest, LangChain, Ollama
* Deploying scalable AI solutions on **AWS Cloud**

I thrive at the intersection of **analytics, AI, and automation**, solving real-world business challenges. Outside of tech, I’m an adventurer 🌍—exploring nature, finding inspiration in new places, and always seeking fresh perspectives.
